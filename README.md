🚨 **This repository is not medical advice.**

This information is intended as a resource to facilitate conversations with your medical provider.

**Adjunctive** refers to interventions that supplement standard surgical care rather than replace it. In this repository, adjuncts include (but are not limited to) nutritional supplements, dietary strategies, non-standard pharmacologic considerations, caffeine/coffee use, and other supportive measures sometimes proposed to affect healing, pain, swelling, sleep, gastrointestinal recovery, or metabolic response.

**Perioperative** refers to the full surgical timeline surrounding an operation, including the pre-operative, intra-operative, and post-operative phases.

## Background

I started this research in preparation for my own upcoming surgical procedure. I wanted to validate or invalidate claims that I'd come across online. If you'd like to help improve or keep this information up to date your contributions are welcome! Please refer to [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Disclaimer about AI Use

This information was researched with large language models: ChatGPT (5.2+) deep research, Gemini (3.0+) research, and Claude (Opus 4.5+) research. AI can make mistakes, and it can hallucinate research. Use these materials only as a starting point. Ideally, all cited research should eventually be reviewed by a human being to ensure that it supports the associated claim. Please see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) if you'd like to help.
