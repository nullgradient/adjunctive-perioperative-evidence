# Low-Carbohydrate Diets After Surgery - Evidence and ERAS Guidelines

## Lack of Evidence for Keto Diets in Post-Surgery Healing

**No Direct Clinical Support.** There are no clinical trials or high-quality studies examining ketogenic or very low-carbohydrate diets as a strategy to reduce postoperative swelling, bruising, or to speed healing in facial feminization surgery (or any surgery). The idea seems based on extrapolation from general anti-inflammatory effects of ketosis rather than surgical evidence. In other words, while ketogenic diets can modulate inflammation in chronic conditions, this has not been shown to translate into better surgical outcomes. A comprehensive search of the literature finds no direct evidence that post-surgical bruising or edema is improved by carb restriction. Leading medical centers instead emphasize a balanced, nutrient-rich diet (ample protein, vitamins, and minerals) for optimal wound healing[^1][^2], rather than any extreme macronutrient restriction.
 
**Anti-Inflammatory vs. Surgical Outcomes.** It is true that ketogenic diets have demonstrated systemic anti-inflammatory effects in certain populations. A 2025 meta-analysis of 44 randomized trials found that adhering to a ketogenic diet led to small but significant reductions in inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6)[^3]. Specifically, TNF-α levels were lower by ~0.32 pg/mL and IL-6 by ~0.27 pg/mL on keto versus higher-carb diets[^3]. Another recent meta-review (218 participants) noted a modest drop in C-reactive protein (~0.6 mg/dL) on ketogenic regimens[^4]. These findings confirm that ketosis can attenuate chronic inflammation markers. However, none of these studies involved surgical patients or measured wound healing or postoperative swelling – they were conducted in contexts like obesity, metabolic syndrome, or autoimmune disease. Thus, extrapolating these cytokine changes to an acute surgical setting is speculative. Surgical trauma triggers a complex acute inflammatory response that has not been studied under ketogenic conditions. As such, there is no clinical evidence that a keto or zero-carb diet improves surgical recovery, and current expert guidance does not endorse it.

## ERAS Protocols and Carbohydrate Loading (Opposite Approach)

Paradoxically, standard surgical best practices actively encourage carbohydrates around the perioperative period, as part of Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) protocols. ERAS is a multidisciplinary, evidence-based program to improve surgical outcomes, and it recommends the opposite of low-carb: preoperative carbohydrate loading instead of fasting[^5]. According to the latest ERAS guidelines, patients should consume a clear carbohydrate-rich drink up to 2–3 hours before anesthesia, rather than undergoing prolonged fasts[^6]. The rationale is that surgical stress normally causes insulin resistance and hyperglycemia after surgery; giving carbs beforehand blunts this stress response. Multiple large studies have validated benefits of this approach:

- **Improved Metabolic Responses.** Preoperative carb drinks attenuate the postoperative insulin resistance by roughly 30–50% relative to overnight fasting[^7]. For example, patients who drink a maltodextrin solution 2–3 hours pre-op have significantly better insulin sensitivity and lower blood sugar elevations after surgery, compared to fasted controls[^8]. A network meta-analysis of 58 trials (nearly 5,000 patients) confirmed that oral carbohydrate loading (even a “low dose” ~50 g) leads to less insulin resistance on postoperative day 1 than fasting or placebo fluids[^9]. In practical terms, the surgical patients given carbs have more stable glucose control and require less insulin, indicating their bodies are handling the stress better.

- **Reduced Inflammatory Markers.** Interestingly, giving carbs before surgery can lower inflammatory cytokines in the early postoperative period. A 2023 systematic review found that patients who consumed a carbohydrate drink had IL-6 levels about 21 pg/mL lower 24 hours after surgery, compared to fasting patients[^8]. (IL-6 is a key inflammatory cytokine that surges after tissue trauma.) This reduction suggests that avoiding ketosis (by providing carbs) actually blunts the surgical inflammatory response. In the same analysis, carb-loaded patients also had higher postoperative albumin levels, indicating less metabolic stress and better nutritional status[^10].

- **Faster Recovery.** Perhaps most tangibly, hospital recovery is slightly faster with carb loading. A recent meta-analysis of 44 RCTs in major surgeries reported that pre-op carbohydrate drinks shortened length of hospital stay by about half a day on average (−0.56 days compared to fasting, 95% CI: −1.10 to −0.02)[^11]. Other reviews similarly find a modest ~0.3–0.5 day reduction in post-op stay when using carb drinks instead of traditional fasting[^12][^11]. While half a day may seem small, in large surgical populations this reflects meaningful improvements in recovery kinetics. Patients also subjectively report less thirst, hunger, and fatigue when they are not starved before surgery – enhancing overall comfort[^13].

Importantly, these benefits have been demonstrated across many surgical types (colorectal, orthopedic, gynecologic, cardiac, etc.), suggesting a generalizable physiological advantage to preoperative carbohydrates. In summary, current best practices run directly counter to perioperative carbohydrate restriction. ERAS protocols embrace carbohydrate loading, not low-carb, because the evidence (dozens of RCTs and multiple meta-analyses in high-impact journals) shows improved metabolic and clinical outcomes[^14][^11]. Adopting a ketogenic or zero-carb approach in the peri-surgical period would explicitly defy these evidence-based guidelines.

## Safety Concerns with Perioperative Ketosis

Beyond the lack of efficacy, putting a patient into ketosis around the time of surgery raises several safety concerns:

- **Metabolic Acidosis.** Prolonged fasting or carb avoidance can drive the body into ketosis which, under anesthesia and surgical stress, may lead to acid–base disturbances. A 2024 retrospective study of 1,535 surgical patients is illuminating: despite only “short-term” preoperative fasts, 59.4% of patients showed ketones in their urine by the time surgery ended, and nearly 29% developed a metabolic acidosis intraoperatively[^15]. Patients with ketonuria had significantly higher risk of moderate-to-severe acidosis during surgery[^15]. The researchers identified ketosis (and longer surgical duration) as key risk factors for this acidosis, and explicitly recommended carbohydrate loading to prevent ketosis and metabolic derangements[^16]. In other words, going into surgery in a ketogenic state can tip the blood pH toward dangerous levels. Case series in pediatric patients on medical ketogenic diets have likewise noted intraoperative acidosis requiring treatment. In one hospital’s experience with children on the keto diet for epilepsy, blood pH dropped as low as 7.16 during lengthy procedures, necessitating IV bicarbonate to correct the acidosis[^17][^18]. While those children generally did fine, the need for buffering underscores that ketosis + anesthesia can induce acidosis that anesthesiologists must actively manage[^17][^19]. Mild metabolic acidosis can impair organ function and recovery; thus intentionally fostering a ketotic state before surgery is not advisable.

- **Hypoglycemia and Electrolyte Imbalances.** Maintaining tight carbohydrate restriction in the perioperative period raises the risk of hypoglycemia (low blood sugar), especially if dextrose-containing IV fluids are avoided. Under anesthesia, patients cannot communicate symptoms, and if blood glucose drops too far it could precipitate neurological injury. Pediatric anesthesia guidelines for keto-diet patients warn to “expect hypoglycemia… Avoid prolonged fasting”[^20]. Although many patients can mount gluconeogenesis to keep sugar normal (as seen in the pediatric series where glucose stayed stable[^21]), the margin of safety is slimmer. Additionally, ketogenic diets cause increased urinary excretion of electrolytes (sodium, potassium, etc.), and fasting or bowel prep can compound this. Ensuring adequate fluid and electrolyte balance is more challenging if the patient is actively ketotic[^22][^23]. Any pre-existing electrolyte disturbances (from the diet or otherwise) could be exacerbated during surgery, potentially affecting heart rhythm or muscle function. In short, deviating from standard peri-op fluids/nutrition could jeopardize metabolic stability unless meticulously managed by the anesthesia team[^22][^24].

- **Interference with Medications and Protocols.** Many IV medications (including some anesthetics, antibiotics, etc.) contain dextrose or need to be diluted in dextrose solutions. A patient attempting to remain in strict ketosis may require special handling of drugs in saline to avoid hidden carbs[^22][^24]. This adds complexity and risk of error. More broadly, a patient on a self-imposed keto regimen might refuse the standard carbohydrate drink before surgery, thereby opting out of ERAS protocols that are known to improve outcomes. Skipping the carb load could increase insulin resistance and inflammatory response – the opposite of what we want – and thus might hinder recovery. In essence, insisting on ketosis might mean not following ERAS, which is a proven bundle of best practices. Unless there is a medical necessity (e.g. the patient is diabetic and using a specific regimen, or on keto for epilepsy), deviating from ERAS nutrition is hard to justify.

- **Bleeding and Wound Healing Considerations.** There is some evidence that ketogenic diets could adversely affect coagulation and possibly healing. An observational study in children on therapeutic keto diets found that about one-third developed excessive bruising and minor bleeding issues, linked to impaired platelet function[^25][^26]. Their platelet aggregation was measurably reduced while on the diet, and normalized after the diet stopped[^27]. No serious hemorrhages occurred, but the authors cautioned that “patients on the diet undergoing surgery should be evaluated carefully for bleeding tendency.”[^26] This suggests a potential for diet-induced clotting changes that could increase bruising – ironically, a ketogenic diet might worsen bruising in susceptible individuals instead of reducing it. Additionally, adequate carbohydrate intake may be important for certain aspects of wound healing (e.g. fibroblast activity and collagen deposition require glucose). Severe carb restriction could theoretically limit the readily available energy needed for repair of surgical tissues. Clinical data are lacking here, but insufficient nutrition (including carbs) is known to delay wound healing[^28]. For instance, hospital nutrition guidelines state it is “not appropriate to follow a restrictive low-energy diet as this could compromise wound healing.”[^29] In sum, being in a catabolic, ketogenic state might impair some healing processes or at least doesn’t confer any known advantage.

## Dietary Recommendations for Post-Surgical Recovery

All available evidence indicates that patients heal best with a well-rounded, nutritious diet, rather than extreme dietary regimens, after surgery. The consensus from surgical nutrition experts is to focus on:

- **Adequate Protein** to support tissue repair (amino acids are the building blocks for wound healing). High-quality protein from lean meats, fish, eggs, dairy, legumes, etc. is critical post-op[^30].

- **Sufficient Calories (Including Carbs)** to fuel the immune response and regeneration. Complex carbohydrates (whole grains, fruits, vegetables) provide energy for cells like fibroblasts and macrophages that drive healing[^28][^31]. Unlike a chronic inflammatory disease where lowering carb intake might help, in acute recovery the body’s energy demands are high. Controlled blood sugar is important (especially for diabetics, to prevent hyperglycemia that hinders healing), but moderate carbs are beneficial for avoiding excessive breakdown of body protein for fuel[^32].

- **Anti-Inflammatory Nutrients** rather than cutting out carbs, patients can include foods known to combat inflammation in a healthy way. For example, omega-3 fatty acids (fatty fish like salmon), antioxidants (berries, leafy greens), and mono-unsaturated fats (olive oil, nuts) are components of the Mediterranean-style diet, which has anti-inflammatory effects. While not studied specifically for surgical bruising, such diets reduce chronic inflammation and support overall health. They also provide vitamins and minerals (A, C, zinc, magnesium, etc.) that are proven to aid wound healing[^33][^34]. These “anti-inflammatory diet” elements can be incorporated in addition to – not in place of – adequate carbohydrates.

In practice, many plastic surgeons and postoperative care teams recommend a balanced “healing diet”: rich in protein, plenty of vegetables and fruits (for micronutrients), whole grains or starchy veggies for energy, and healthy fats. This ensures the body has all substrates required for repair. Notably, one should avoid restrictive dieting during the recovery period, as caloric or carbohydrate deficits can impair immune function and slow wound closure[^29]. For example, a patient on an aggressively low-carb or calorie diet might experience fatigue, poor granulation tissue formation, or even muscle loss that hampers rehab.

In summary, the initial findings are validated: there is no support in the scientific literature for using zero-carb or ketogenic diets to improve postoperative bruising/swelling, especially in facial plastic surgery. On the contrary, decades of research and modern ERAS protocols favor a carbhydrate-inclusive approach for optimal recovery. Large, reputable studies (some analyzing dozens of trials and thousands of patients) consistently show that pre-surgical carb loading and a well-fed state lead to better outcomes (less inflammation, better insulin response, slightly faster recovery)[^14][^11]. In contrast, pushing patients into ketosis around surgery has no proven benefit and carries potential risks (metabolic acidosis, hypoglycemia, platelet changes)[^15][^26]. Until high-quality human trials demonstrate a clear advantage to low-carb in surgical healing – which so far none have – the best practice is to stick with evidence-backed nutritional strategies: don’t cut the carbs when healing from cuts.

References: Recent meta-analyses and guidelines on ERAS and nutrition[^14][^11][^8], surgical nutrition guidance from oncology centers[^1][^29], and studies on ketosis in surgical contexts[^15][^25] all reinforce these conclusions. No new research (as of 2025) has overturned this advice. Patients seeking to minimize bruising or swelling should focus on standard measures (proper surgical technique, cold compresses, elevation, adequate protein/vitamins, perhaps Arnica as some surgeons recommend) – not carb deprivation. The bottom line: a ketogenic diet after surgery is unsupported and likely counterproductive, whereas balanced nutrition and ERAS protocols are the proven path to enhanced recovery.
