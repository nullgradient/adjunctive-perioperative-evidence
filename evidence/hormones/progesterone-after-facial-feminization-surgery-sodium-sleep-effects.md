# Progesterone After Facial Feminization Surgery - Sodium and Sleep Effects

## No Proven Benefit in Trauma Recovery (TBI Trials)

Extensive high-quality trials indicate progesterone does not improve recovery from acute trauma. Two large Phase III RCTs in traumatic brain injury (TBI) – the international SyNAPSe trial (n=1,195) and the US ProTECT III trial – found no difference in neurologic outcomes between progesterone-treated and placebo groups[^1][^2]. In SyNAPSe, about 50% of patients had a favorable outcome in both the progesterone and placebo arms[^1]. A 2015 meta-analysis pooling 6 RCTs (total n=2,476) confirmed progesterone did not reduce mortality (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.57–1.20) or long-term disability after TBI[^3]. These large trials overturned earlier small studies that had suggested possible benefits, firmly showing no improvement in recovery or survival with progesterone in severe acute injury[^4][^5]. While TBI is a specific context, these robust data refute any broad “healing” advantage of progesterone after major trauma.

## Effects on Sodium Balance and Fluid Retention

Progesterone has well-documented antimineralocorticoid properties that affect sodium and water balance. Progesterone binds the renal mineralocorticoid (aldosterone) receptor and acts as a competitive antagonist, causing a mild natriuresis (sodium excretion)[^6]. Through this mechanism, progesterone increases sodium excretion and prevents estrogen-related water retention[^6]. In other words, estrogen tends to promote fluid retention, whereas progesterone can counteract this by promoting salt and water loss. This diuretic effect has been observed in contexts like hormone therapy: for example, adding a progestin with antimineralocorticoid activity leads to slight reductions in body weight and blood pressure compared to estrogen alone[^7][^8]. However, it’s important to note that no clinical studies in postoperative patients (including facial feminization surgery) specifically examine progesterone’s impact on serum sodium or edema. Any reduction in fluid retention from progesterone is likely modest. In a postoperative setting, standard measures (adequate hydration, limiting IV fluids, and using diuretics if needed) are the primary ways to manage sodium/fluid balance. While in theory progesterone could reduce swelling by countering sodium retention, this remains speculative without direct evidence in surgical patients.

## Progesterone and Sleep Quality

Progesterone’s metabolites (like allopregnanolone) interact with GABA\_A receptors in the brain, producing sedative and anxiolytic effects[^9]. Indeed, there is evidence from non-surgical populations that oral micronized progesterone can improve sleep quality. A recent randomized trial in 189 perimenopausal women (300 mg at bedtime) reported significantly better perceived sleep quality with progesterone vs placebo[^10]. The women on progesterone felt their sleep had improved (P = 0.005) along with a reduction in night sweats[^11]. A systematic review of 9 trials (mostly in menopausal women) likewise found progesterone modestly benefits sleep: for example, pooled data showed progesterone shortened sleep onset by ~7 minutes compared to placebo (though total sleep time improvements were not statistically significant)[^12]. Notably, most trials reported improved self-rated sleep when on progesterone[^13]. These sedative properties suggest progesterone could help post-surgical insomnia or restlessness. However, no studies have tested progesterone for sleep in post-operative patients, so this is extrapolated evidence.

In the context of transgender women (who often receive progesterone as part of gender-affirming hormone therapy), the sleep benefits are unclear. A small 2022 prospective study in trans women starting low-dose progesterone (100 mg nightly) found no significant difference in sleep quality over 3 months compared to controls on estrogen alone[^14]. Only about 1 in 4 patients in each group had a clinically meaningful sleep improvement, suggesting progesterone at that dose did not markedly improve sleep[^14]. It’s possible that higher doses (e.g. 200–300 mg) or longer use might yield more benefit, since most positive data in cisgender women used 300 mg. Overall, progesterone may aid sleep via its sedative metabolite effects, but for post-surgical sleep disturbances this remains an unproven but plausible use. Patients should also be cautioned that progesterone can cause sedation/dizziness, so nighttime dosing and care with activities (no driving after taking it, etc.) are advised.

## Wound Healing and Recovery of Tissues

The idea that progesterone might promote wound healing has some biological plausibility but only limited preclinical evidence. In animal models, progesterone (like estrogen) appears to shift the immune response toward a repair-friendly profile. After injury, macrophages can adopt either a pro-inflammatory “M1” activation or a pro-repair “M2” activation. In an ovariectomized mouse wound-healing model (mimicking low female hormones), researchers found reduced markers of M2 macrophages and impaired healing. Treatment with estrogen or progesterone restored alternative (M2) macrophage activation, promoting tissue repair, angiogenesis and remodeling[^15]. This suggests that the presence of progesterone may help tip the wound environment toward regeneration rather than excess inflammation. In vitro studies also report that progesterone can directly aid skin cells – it stimulates keratinocyte cell migration (important for re-epithelialization), suppresses fibroblast production of matrix-degrading enzymes (MMPs), and induces TIMPs (tissue inhibitors of MMPs), overall supporting matrix preservation[^16]. These actions could theoretically improve wound strength and speed healing.

Despite these promising laboratory findings, clinical evidence in humans is lacking. There have been no controlled trials of progesterone to improve surgical wound healing or recovery. (By contrast, estrogen has been tested in some contexts for wound healing in older patients, with mixed results.) Some observational data in older women suggest hormone therapy might correlate with better healing of chronic wounds[^17], but isolating progesterone’s role is difficult. In summary, while progesterone has pro-repair effects in experimental models, there is no direct human data that giving progesterone after surgery speeds wound closure, reduces scarring, or improves tissue recovery. Any consideration of progesterone for wound-healing benefit is therefore based on mechanistic rationale only, not on demonstrated clinical outcomes.

## Safety Considerations in the Perioperative Period

When evaluating progesterone use after surgery, safety is an important consideration – especially regarding blood clot risk and other side effects. In the TBI trials where progesterone was given intravenously (over several days), an unexpected finding was a tripling of phlebitis/thrombophlebitis incidence in the progesterone group[^3]. Specifically, the meta-analysis noted an elevated risk of infusion-site thrombophlebitis (RR ~3.03, 95% CI 1.96–4.66) associated with progesterone treatment[^3]. This likely resulted from the IV formulation (progesterone is lipophilic and was given in a lipid solution that irritated veins). Such a risk would not apply to oral progesterone, but it underscores that progesterone is not entirely benign. Progesterone itself is not known for major pro-coagulant effects – in fact, unlike estrogen, natural progesterone does not significantly increase clotting factors. However, any hormone therapy in a post-surgical patient warrants caution, since surgery already elevates thrombosis risk. Transgender women and postmenopausal women on hormone therapy are usually advised to resume hormones cautiously after major surgery to mitigate DVT risk. If progesterone were used post-FFS (which often involves reduced mobility during recovery), it would be prudent to also implement standard DVT prophylaxis as indicated.

Other side effects to consider include sedation (as noted, progesterone can cause drowsiness and dizziness) and potential mood effects. Most studies find micronized progesterone well-tolerated; for example, the perimenopausal RCT reported no serious adverse events[^18]. In the transgender study, one individual experienced worsened mood on progesterone that resolved upon stopping[^19] – highlighting that responses can vary. Overall, short-term progesterone (oral) is generally safe, but its addition in the perioperative setting should be weighed against unclear benefit. Patients should be monitored for leg discomfort or swelling (signs of thrombosis) and advised about the sedative effects. Notably, if the goal is improving sleep, other interventions (pain control, sleep hygiene, maybe non-opioid sedatives) might be tried first given the lack of robust data for progesterone.

## Conclusion and Perspective

Current evidence does not support routine progesterone use after facial feminization surgery for benefits like lowering sodium or improving sleep, beyond what standard care provides. The initial findings are validated: major trauma trials show no improvement in recovery outcomes with progesterone, casting doubt on any generalized healing benefit[^1][^3]. For sleep quality, progesterone has shown efficacy in menopausal women’s insomnia[^10] and in some lab measures[^12], but this has not been studied in post-surgical patients and a small trial in trans women showed no clear benefit[^14]. Wound healing evidence is limited to animals, where progesterone can foster a pro-repair environment[^15], but there are no human surgical trials confirming improved healing. On the other hand, safety data suggest mostly good tolerability with oral progesterone, though IV use carried significant phlebitis risk and any hormonal addition after surgery requires vigilance for clots[^3].

In practice, many transfeminine patients are prescribed progesterone (along with estrogen) for longer-term feminization goals, and some anecdotally report better sleep or mood. Using progesterone short-term after FFS might confer some subjective sleep improvement or slight reduction in fluid retention, but the evidence is inconclusive. Clinicians should ensure that basic postoperative care (pain control, DVT prophylaxis, fluid management) is optimized, and if considering progesterone, do so on a case-by-case basis, weighing the potential benefits against the uncertain efficacy. Until more research is done in surgical populations, any benefit of progesterone in dropping sodium (diuresis) or enhancing recovery remains unproven – with robust data leaning toward no significant impact on physical recovery, as demonstrated in other clinical scenarios[^4][^3]. Thus, the current evidence supports the initial report’s cautious conclusion: progesterone’s supposed benefits in post-surgical recovery are not backed by solid clinical data, and its routine use for this purpose is not justified given the lack of proven benefit and potential risks.
