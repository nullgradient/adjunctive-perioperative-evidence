## 🟢 Strong Evidence for Use

### Zinc

Evidence details: [Zinc Supplementation for Post-Surgical Wound Healing](supplements/zinc-supplementation-post-surgical-wound-healing.md)

- Treat/avoid zinc deficiency to support wound healing and reduce wound complications. Across older RCT signals plus modern synthesis, benefit is most consistent when baseline zinc is low (deficiency/suboptimal status).
- Short-term perioperative zinc (typ. ~30–50 mg elemental/day for a few weeks) may improve healing-related outcomes, especially in high-demand states (large wounds/burns/chronic wounds) and may reduce infection/inflammation in some surgical settings.
- Evidence base includes a recent meta-analysis of small RCTs suggesting improved healing endpoints overall, but trials are heterogeneous and often small.
- In well-nourished patients with uncomplicated acute surgical wounds, speed-of-closure benefits are inconsistent; some studies suggest infection/colonization improvements more than faster closure.
- **⚠️Risks/cautions:** Chronic/high dosing (commonly ≥50 mg/day for many weeks) can cause copper deficiency (anemia/neutropenia); GI upset is possible. Separate dosing from quinolones/tetracyclines to avoid absorption issues.

### Methylfolate + Methylcobalamin

Evidence details: [Methylfolate and Methylcobalamin in Surgical Recovery](supplements/methylfolate-methylcobalamin-surgical-recovery.md)

- Preventing/treating deficiency in high-risk groups (e.g., post-bariatric surgery, restrictive diets) is strongly evidence-based as standard care (prevention of anemia/neuropathy), though not proven as a “recovery accelerator.”
- Perioperative B12 adequacy is clinically important when nitrous oxide (N₂O) is used, because N₂O can inactivate B12 and precipitate neurologic injury in deficient patients (benefit is harm prevention, not faster healing).
- Nerve recovery: mixed—one non-randomized positive signal in a specific neuro-rehab combination, but a double-blind RCT in knee arthroplasty showed no benefit for incision numbness with methylcobalamin.
- Folate and chronic ulcers: some supportive controlled/observational data in diabetic/venous ulcers, but not directly generalizable to acute surgical incisions.
- No RCTs demonstrating that methylfolate or methylcobalamin improves general surgical wound healing or speeds overall recovery in otherwise replete patients.
- **⚠️Risks/cautions:** Generally low; key practical risk is masking B12 deficiency with high folate (less relevant if B12 status is ensured). Main perioperative concern is unrecognized B12 deficiency + N₂O exposure (harm from deficiency, not the supplement).

### Caffeine / Coffee (post-op)

Evidence details: [Caffeine Use After Surgery and Recovery Outcomes](diet-and-lifestyle/caffeine-use-after-surgery-recovery-outcomes.md)

- Postoperative coffee to speed GI recovery after abdominal surgery (multiple RCTs/meta-analyses): earlier bowel function, reduced ileus risk, and shorter LOS in several populations (colorectal/gynecologic/C-section).
- Analgesic adjuvant: adding caffeine to standard analgesics modestly improves pain relief (Cochrane-level evidence).
- Withdrawal headache prevention in habitual users: perioperative caffeine (including IV caffeine in PACU) reduces headache incidence in RCT data.
- Reduced facial swelling: limited to a single dental implant RCT using an acetaminophen+caffeine combination vs acetaminophen+codeine.
- Anesthesia emergence / alertness: suggestive but not definitive; confounded observational data.
- No direct evidence facial plastic surgeries for improved wound healing or reduced bruising.
- **⚠️Risks/cautions:** No consistent clinical signal of harm at moderate intake in studies, but plausible perioperative issues include transient BP/HR increases, dehydration if fluid intake is poor, and lab (non-clinical) evidence suggesting impaired epithelialization at high exposures. Practical implication: moderation + hydration, and defer to surgeon-specific restrictions in high-bleeding-risk facial cases.

## 🟢 Moderate Evidence for Use

### Bromelain for Oral/Maxillofacial and Bone-Involving Facial Surgery

Evidence details: [Bromelain for Oral, Maxillofacial, and Bone-Involving Facial Surgery](supplements/bromelain-oral-maxillofacial-bone-surgery.md)

- Postoperative pain reduction after oral/maxillofacial procedures has moderate-to-strong support: meta-analysis of 6 RCTs in third molar surgery showed significant pain reduction at 24 hours and 7 days (SMD -0.49 to -0.52), comparable to NSAIDs.
- Bruise/ecchymosis resolution is procedure-dependent: significant benefit in rhinoplasty with osteotomies (RCT, p=0.012 by day 7); no significant effect in blepharoplasty (p=0.67). Efficacy correlates with fibrin-rich hematoma volume from bone trauma.
- Swelling/edema outcomes are mixed across meta-analyses; some show benefit at 2–3 days and 7 days post-op, while others do not. Variation may reflect measurement techniques and procedure type.
- Trismus outcomes are mixed/inconclusive: some reviews suggest improvement in mouth opening, while others find no significant effect by day 7; depends on included trials and measurement methods.
- **⚠️Risks/cautions:** Biologic anticoagulant/antiplatelet effects (ex vivo PT prolongation up to 47%; platelet aggregation inhibition ~19%) raise a plausible hematoma/bleeding risk, especially with anticoagulants/antiplatelets or in bleeding-prone patients. Practical implication: many periop protocols conservatively recommend stopping 10–14 days pre-op; any "pre-loading" strategy should be surgeon-directed.

### Collagen peptides + Vitamin C

Evidence details: [Collagen Peptides + Vitamin C for Post-FFS Healing and Bruising](supplements/collagen-peptides-vitamin-c-post-ffs-healing-bruising.md)

- Collagen peptides: RCT evidence in high-demand wound contexts (e.g., burns; pressure ulcers) suggests faster wound closure/improved wound scores.
- Vitamin C: RCT evidence in oral surgery indicates reduced early swelling/pain and improved short-term wound parameters; correcting insufficiency is biologically and clinically important.
- Direct evidence for reducing bruising in elective surgery is limited; the rationale is strongest for patients with suboptimal intake or higher tissue-repair demands.
- No direct trials in FFS demonstrating improved cosmetic outcomes, scar quality, or complication reduction.
- **⚠️Risks/cautions:** Generally low risk. Allergy/source issues (marine collagen in fish-allergic individuals). High-dose vitamin C can cause GI upset and may increase kidney stone risk in predisposed individuals. No clear bleeding-risk signal at typical doses.

## 🟡 Limited or Mixed Evidence for Use

### Astaxanthin (pre-op use)

Evidence details: [Astaxanthin Use Before Surgery - Evidence and Considerations](supplements/astaxanthin-use-before-surgery-evidence-considerations.md)

- No strong or moderate perioperative RCT evidence showing improved surgical outcomes.
- Limited human perioperative evidence (small, non-randomized cataract surgery studies) suggests reduced local oxidative stress and lower early post-op inflammation.
- Strong preclinical (animal) evidence for protection in ischemia–reperfusion injury models, but translation to routine elective surgery remains uncertain.
- No robust clinical evidence supporting routine pre-op astaxanthin to improve healing, pain, swelling, or complication rates across surgeries.
- **⚠️Risks/cautions:** Bleeding/anticoagulant concern: animal data show prolonged clotting times and reduced platelet aggregation; plus a warfarin interaction case report with extreme INR elevation and bruising. Practical implication: avoid perioperatively unless surgeon/anesthesia explicitly agree, and avoid particularly with anticoagulants/antiplatelets.

### BPC-157 for Improving Surgical Outcomes and Recovery

Evidence details: [BPC-157 for Improving Surgical Outcomes and Recovery](supplements/bpc-157-improving-surgical-outcomes-recovery.md)

- Rationale/preclinical:** Strong and consistent animal/in vitro signals across multiple tissue types (skin incisions/burns, tendon/ligament, muscle-to-bone repair, fractures/bone defects, GI anastomosis and fistulas), including improved collagen organization, angiogenesis, and tensile/biomechanical strength.
- Human evidence is early/low quality for perioperative use:** Human data consist mainly of a Phase I safety study (short-term oral exposure) and small pilot/observational reports in non-surgical or not-clearly-perioperative contexts (e.g., knee pain injections; bladder pain/interstitial cystitis intravesical injection). These do **not** establish that BPC-157 improves routine surgical wound healing, swelling/bruising, infection rates, scar quality, or recovery time in typical surgical patients.
- No direct trials in facial plastic surgery/FFS (or in elective surgical recovery broadly) demonstrating clinically meaningful benefit; randomized perioperative trials are limited/ongoing.
- Practical interpretation: At present, BPC-157 remains an experimental candidate with impressive preclinical breadth but insufficient human perioperative efficacy evidence to recommend routine use as a “recovery accelerator.”
- **⚠️Risks/cautions:** Regulatory/quality risk is central (not FDA-approved; access often via unregulated “research” supply with contamination/mislabelling risk; compounding restrictions). Safety data in humans are limited by small sample sizes and short follow-up. Theoretical concerns include pro-angiogenic effects (uncertain implications in patients with active/occult malignancy) and unknown interactions with perioperative medications. Use (if considered at all) should be surgeon/anesthesia-directed and avoided when product quality and medical oversight cannot be assured.

## 🟠 No Evidence for Use

### Progesterone (post-FFS “sodium/sleep/healing”)

Evidence details: [Progesterone After Facial Feminization Surgery - Sodium and Sleep Effects](hormones/progesterone-after-facial-feminization-surgery-sodium-sleep-effects.md)

- No controlled human surgical trials demonstrating progesterone improves wound healing, swelling, bruising, or overall recovery after surgery/FFS.
- Sleep improvement: moderate evidence in perimenopausal cis women (and meta-analytic support for some sleep parameters) that oral micronized progesterone can improve perceived sleep—this is not surgical evidence and may not generalize.
- Transfeminine-specific sleep data are limited and not clearly positive (small prospective controlled study showed no significant sleep benefit at 100 mg).
- Mechanistic/animal wound-healing rationale exists but is not validated in human surgical trials.
- Sodium/fluid effects are plausible (antimineralocorticoid activity) but unproven postoperatively.
- Large trauma trials (TBI) show no recovery benefit in a major-injury context.
- **⚠️Risks/cautions:** IV progesterone in TBI trials increased thrombophlebitis (likely formulation-related), reminding that progesterone is not risk-free in acute care contexts. Any hormone use post-op requires attention to VTE risk in the perioperative period (context-dependent). Sedation/dizziness can be clinically relevant.

## 🔴 Evidence of Harm with Use

### Low-carbohydrate / Ketogenic diets (peri- and post-op)

Evidence details: [Low-Carbohydrate Diets After Surgery - Evidence and ERAS Guidelines](diet-and-lifestyle/low-carbohydrate-diets-after-surgery-evidence-eras-guidelines.md)

- None for surgical recovery; evidence-based periop nutrition practices generally go the opposite direction (ERAS carbohydrate strategies).
- Keto can reduce chronic inflammatory markers in non-surgical populations, but this is not evidence of benefit in acute surgical healing.
- No clinical trials showing keto/very-low-carb improves postoperative bruising, swelling, wound healing, or recovery in surgery (including FFS).
- **⚠️Risks/cautions:** Evidence of perioperative risk signals: ketosis associated with metabolic acidosis in fasted surgical patients; pediatric keto anesthesia experience includes clinically significant acidosis requiring treatment; potential hypoglycemia/electrolyte challenges; and observational evidence of platelet function changes/bruising in some keto patients. Clinical implication: avoid intentional perioperative ketosis unless medically indicated and managed by the surgical/anesthesia team; follow ERAS-style nutrition when appropriate.

### High-dose Vitamin D (for bone healing)

Evidence details: [High-Dose Vitamin D and Post-Surgical Bone Healing](supplements/high-dose-vitamin-d-post-surgical-bone-healing.md)

- Correct vitamin D deficiency to support normal bone health (standard of care rationale), but this is distinct from “high-dose for faster healing.”
- Limited: one small lumbar fusion RCT suggests possible faster time-to-fusion and better early pain/function with modest dosing (800 IU/day) plus calcium, but not clearly improved final fusion rates.
- Observational associations link low vitamin D with poorer orthopedic outcomes, but intervention trials for “boosting healing” are largely negative.
- High-dose or bolus vitamin D does not reliably improve fracture union/healing in RCTs and systematic reviews; no evidence in craniofacial/FFS osteotomies.
- **⚠️Risks/cautions:** High-dose/bolus regimens can be harmful: RCT signal of worsened bone microarchitecture in one distal radius fracture trial; known toxicity risk (hypercalcemia) with excessive dosing; large intermittent doses linked to increased falls/fractures in other populations. Clinical implication: aim for sufficiency, avoid mega-dosing unless medically indicated and monitored.
