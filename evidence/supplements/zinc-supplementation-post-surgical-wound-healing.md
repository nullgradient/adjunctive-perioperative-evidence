# Zinc Supplementation for Post-Surgical Wound Healing

Facial feminization surgery (FFS) involves extensive soft-tissue and bony surgery, making optimal wound healing crucial. While no studies specifically examine zinc in FFS patients, evidence from general surgical and wound-healing research suggests zinc supplementation can improve healing outcomes, especially in patients who are zinc-deficient. Below we review the current evidence, including systematic reviews and key clinical studies across various surgical contexts, and discuss safety considerations.

## Evidence from Reviews and Meta-Analyses

- 2025 Meta-Analysis (5 RCTs, 178 patients): A recent systematic review and meta-analysis found that zinc treatment significantly improved wound/ulcer healing outcomes. Pooled results showed a ~41% relative improvement in healing (measure of ulcers healed at final follow-up: RR ≈1.41, 95% CI 1.04–1.92, p = 0.03) with minimal heterogeneity. The authors rated the evidence as moderate quality, highlighting zinc as one of the most effective interventions among nine evaluated. Notably, this benefit was most pronounced in patients with zinc deficiency, consistent with earlier findings (see below).

- Cochrane & Earlier Reviews: A 2014 Cochrane review (updating earlier evidence) concluded that overall oral zinc did not significantly increase healing of chronic leg ulcers, except possibly in patients with low baseline zinc levels.[^1] Similarly, a 2001 JAMA Dermatology review of zinc for leg ulcers found no overall benefit but noted a substantial effect in zinc-deficient subgroups. These reviews underscored that many early trials were small or methodologically limited, but the consistent theme is that zinc supplementation appears beneficial when a true zinc deficiency is present, whereas its benefit in well-nourished patients is less clear.

- Mechanistic Rationale: Surgery and trauma can acutely lower plasma zinc levels due to increased metabolic demand and losses (e.g. via wound exudate). Zinc is a cofactor in collagen synthesis, immune function, and tissue repair, so zinc deficiency is well known to delay wound healing and increase infection risk. This biologic rationale aligns with the clinical evidence that repletion of zinc (in deficient patients) can accelerate healing.

## Key Clinical Studies in Surgical Wound Healing

Several clinical trials in different surgical and wound-healing settings have evaluated zinc supplementation (oral or topical). Collectively, these trials support a positive effect on healing rate and infection outcomes, particularly in patients with zinc deficiency or at high risk of poor healing:

- Chronic Leg Ulcers (Hallböök & Lanner 1972): In a double-blind RCT of 27 patients with chronic venous ulcers, oral zinc sulfate (≈200 mg ZnSO₄ thrice daily) did not significantly outpace placebo overall (ulcer healing in 69% vs 57% of patients at 18 weeks). However, among zinc-deficient patients (baseline serum Zn <16.8 μmol/L ≈ 110 μg/dL), the treatment effect was dramatic: ulcers healed in 5 of 7 zinc-supplemented patients vs 1 of 7 on placebo (relative risk 5.0, albeit not significant due to small N). Moreover, the wound epithelialization rate in deficient patients was about 5-fold higher with zinc than placebo (roughly 5–7 mm²/day vs 1.4 mm²/day). This pivotal early trial suggests zinc accelerates healing greatly in patients who are zinc-deficient, while having little impact if zinc status is normal.

- Large Surgical Wounds (Pilonidal Sinus Excision): A classic randomized trial in the late 1960s on extensive pilonidal wound cavities demonstrated significantly faster healing with zinc. Patients given oral zinc sulfate 220 mg three times daily had a 43% shorter time to complete wound closure compared to placebo. (Notably, serum zinc was not measured in that study, but large pilonidal wounds often create a substantial zinc demand for healing.) This finding was later supported by a modern multicenter RCT (2006) in 64 patients with open pilonidal excision wounds: 3% topical zinc oxide dressings modestly reduced median time to closure (54 vs 62 days, p = 0.32) and did not significantly accelerate healing time overall. Importantly, however, infection-related outcomes improved with topical zinc: only 3 zinc-treated patients required antibiotics postoperatively versus 12 in the placebo group (p = 0.005), and wounds treated with zinc had reduced *Staphylococcus aureus* colonization. No adverse effects were noted. These results suggest that while zinc may not dramatically speed closure of acute surgical wounds in well-nourished patients, it can reduce infection rates and complications, contributing to better healing quality.

- Burn Injuries: Burn patients often experience acute zinc loss and are prone to deficiencies. In a controlled trial on burn wound healing, oral zinc supplementation improved healing times. For example, Brodribb and Ricketts (1971) reported that zinc therapy reduced mean healing time for deep (grafted) burns by ~19% (72 days vs 58 days)[^2], and by ~21% for superficial burns,[^3] compared to standard care. Some pediatric burn studies also noted faster recovery: e.g. zinc-treated children had a shorter hospital stay (5.3 vs 7.5 days in one series) and a higher rate of wound closure.[^4] Though data in burns are mixed (not all studies reached significance[^5]), these findings align with the idea that zinc repletion improves healing in highly catabolic, zinc-depleted states (such as large burns).

- Orthopedic Surgery (Total Hips): Zinc’s predictive value for wound healing is well illustrated in orthopedics. A prospective study of 97 hip fracture patients undergoing hemiarthroplasty found preoperative zinc levels strongly predicted healing outcomes. Patients with low serum zinc (<95 μg/dL) had an 11.8-fold higher risk of delayed wound healing than those with normal levels. In other words, zinc deficiency was associated with a dramatically increased risk of wound complications. Consistently, a similar study in elective total hip replacements noted that low zinc was a significant risk factor for prolonged wound drainage and infection. These observational findings reinforce why supplementation is particularly considered in patients with marginal nutritional status. While formal trials of zinc in orthopedic surgery are limited, it is plausible that correcting zinc deficiency in these patients would improve wound healing and reduce infection or dehiscence rates, as suggested by the risk data.

- Cardiac Surgery (CABG): A recent double-blind RCT in coronary bypass patients tested a perioperative zinc + antioxidant regimen. In 78 patients undergoing CABG, the intervention group received 120 mg zinc (elemental) + 1200 IU vitamin E the day before surgery, then 30 mg zinc + 200 IU vitamin E daily for 3 weeks post-op. Results: The treated group had a significantly shorter hospital length of stay (LOS) than placebo (on average by ~1–2 days, p < 0.05). Additionally, they showed a blunted inflammatory response: post-op levels of CRP and other cytokine/inflammatory markers (e.g. interferon-γ, pentraxin-3, etc.) were markedly lower with zinc+E supplementation. The authors concluded that perioperative zinc (with vitamin E) reduced systemic inflammation and sped recovery in CABG patients. This trial is notable because it used a high-dose loading strategy followed by maintenance dosing, demonstrating both safety and efficacy (see Safety below). It also underscores zinc’s role in controlling inflammation – an important aspect of post-surgical healing. While vitamin E was co-administered (making it a combined therapy), the significant rise in plasma zinc levels and improved outcomes suggests zinc was a key contributor.

Summary: Across these studies, zinc supplementation tends to improve wound healing outcomes – speeding up healing in some contexts (especially chronic wounds or burns), and reducing infections/inflammation in others – with the greatest benefits observed in patients who are zinc-deficient or under significant physiological stress. In well-nourished patients with uncomplicated wounds, zinc may offer a more modest or even negligible speed benefit, but still might enhance the quality of healing (e.g. fewer infections). Given that some FFS patients could have underlying nutritional deficiencies or high postoperative demands, it is reasonable to consider zinc as part of optimization.

## Safety and Dosing Considerations

Zinc supplementation is generally safe in the typical dosage ranges used for wound healing, but proper dosing and duration are important:

- Common Doses: Trials have used around 30–50 mg of elemental zinc per day during the healing period without issue. This is a moderate dose (roughly 2–3 times the RDA for adults). For example, 30 mg/day is a common supplemental dose deemed safe for short-term use. Some perioperative protocols include a one-time loading dose (≈100–120 mg) the day before surgery (to rapidly correct any subclinical deficiency), followed by ~30 mg daily post-op. In the CABG study above, this high-dose regimen for several weeks was well-tolerated and did not report any adverse effects or copper imbalance in that timeframe. Topical zinc (e.g. 3% zinc oxide dressings) is also safe, causing no significant pain or dermatitis in trials.

- Upper Limits: Excessive zinc can cause side effects (nausea, GI irritation in the short term), and more critically, chronic high-dose zinc can induce copper deficiency. Intakes of ≥50 mg zinc per day over many weeks begin to interfere with copper absorption. Prolonged high doses may lead to anemia and neutropenia due to copper deficiency. Thus, most experts advise not exceeding ~40 mg zinc daily long-term without medical supervision.[^6] If higher doses are used for a limited period, monitoring or co-supplementing with a small amount of copper (e.g. 2 mg for each 30 mg Zn) is sometimes recommended. In the context of post-surgical use, the duration is usually short (a few weeks), so risk is low, but it’s wise to avoid going much beyond 50 mg/day unless deficiency is confirmed.

- Interactions: Zinc may reduce absorption of certain antibiotics (like quinolones or tetracyclines) if taken simultaneously, so timing supplements a few hours apart from medications is prudent. It can also cause mild stomach upset; taking it with food mitigates this. Overall, at 30–50 mg/day for a limited postoperative period, zinc is very well tolerated. No serious adverse events have been reported in wound-healing trials at these doses. The main caution is to avoid unwarranted long-term high dosing.

In summary, zinc supplementation has a reasonably strong evidence base for enhancing wound healing in surgical patients – it appears to reduce healing time in certain wounds and lower infection and complication rates. The benefit is most evident in those with zinc deficiency or large healing challenges (chronic ulcers, burns, etc.), but even in routine surgeries it may aid recovery (as seen with reduced inflammatory markers and hospital stay in the CABG trial). For FFS patients, it would be prudent to assess nutritional status; if zinc levels are low or dietary intake is poor, supplementing (e.g. 30 mg/day) during the perioperative period could improve outcomes. Given its favorable safety at moderate doses and critical role in tissue repair, zinc is often recommended as part of a comprehensive post-surgical nutrition plan, alongside adequate protein, vitamin C, etc. (indeed, specialized wound-healing supplements for plastic surgery often include zinc). Ensuring sufficient zinc can be a simple, low-cost measure to promote optimal healing after facial feminization or other surgical procedures.
