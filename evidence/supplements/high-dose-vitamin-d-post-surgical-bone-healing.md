# High-Dose Vitamin D and Post-Surgical Bone Healing

Vitamin D is important for calcium absorption and bone mineralization. Severe deficiency impairs bone healing (e.g. osteomalacia), so it was hypothesized that extra vitamin D might speed recovery after fractures or surgeries involving bone cuts. Early animal studies suggested high-dose vitamin D could enhance fracture repair, but human data have not borne this out.[^1][^2] Many orthopedic surgeons routinely check and correct vitamin D levels, especially in patients with fractures or spinal fusions, to ensure normal healing. The key question is whether supraphysiologic “high-dose” supplementation (far above standard daily needs) improves bone healing in otherwise healthy adults. Below we summarize the best available evidence from clinical studies.

## Evidence from Fracture-Healing Trials

Research in fracture patients has generally found no significant benefit to vitamin D supplementation on healing outcomes, even at high doses:

- **2023 Systematic Review (14 studies, 2,734 patients)[^2]:** Vitamin D supplementation “does little to influence fracture healing and subsequent union rates or functional outcome.” Most trials showed no difference in fracture union or complications between vitamin D and control groups. A few low-quality studies reported slight improvements (e.g. fewer early complications within 30 days), but no consistent effect on radiological healing. The review concluded that current evidence does not support routine vitamin D for fracture healing, absent deficiency, and called for higher-quality RCTs.

- **Distal Radius Fracture RCT (2021, *JBMR*, n = 32)[^1][^3][^4][^5]:** Postmenopausal women with wrist fractures were randomized to no supplement vs low-dose (~700 IU/day) vs high-dose (~1800 IU/day) vitamin D₃ for 6 weeks.[^3][^4] The high-dose group had worse bone microarchitecture: by 12 weeks they showed significantly decreased trabecular bone number and lower bone stiffness, along with increased bone resorption markers (CTX), compared to controls.[^5] Low-dose vitamin D showed no significant improvement either. Final healing (by high-resolution CT and clinical assessment) was not enhanced in either supplement group. Investigators warned that an 1800 IU/day-equivalent bolus “may be detrimental” to bone recovery in the early healing phase.[^5]

- **Long Bone Fracture RCT – “Vita-Shock” Trial (2022, *JBMR Plus*, n = 102)[^6][^7][^8]:** Young adults with acute tibia or femur fractures (treated with intramedullary rods) received one of four regimens: (1) two 150,000 IU vitamin D₃ boluses (at injury and 6 weeks), (2) daily 4,000 IU, (3) daily 600 IU, or (4) placebo.[^6][^7] After 3 months (primary endpoint) and even at 12 months, there were no statistically significant differences in fracture healing between any vitamin D dose and placebo.[^8] Radiographic union scores (RUST) and functional recovery (FIX-IT index) were similar across groups. A minor trend toward higher clinical scores with high-dose D (vs. placebo) was noted in post-hoc analysis, but it was not significant (p ~0.16).[^8] In sum, no clear benefit on fracture healing was demonstrated with either daily high-dose or large loading doses of vitamin D.

Notably, most fracture studies ensured baseline vitamin D levels were not severely deficient – many patients were vitamin D insufficient, but all groups typically received calcium and standard care. Thus, these trials tested extra vitamin D on top of normal bone care.

## Spinal Fusion and Surgical Bone Healing

Bone healing is also critical in spinal fusion surgery (where vertebrae are surgically fused). Here again, evidence for high-dose vitamin D is limited:

- **Lumbar Spinal Fusion RCT (2022, n = 34)[^9][^10][^11][^12]:** In the only RCT to date for vitamin D in spine surgery, patients undergoing lumbar fusion were given 800 IU/day of vitamin D₃ + 600 mg calcium vs calcium alone for 3 months post-op.[^9][^10] The primary outcome – 1-year fusion success on imaging – was high in both groups and not significantly different (95.2% with vitamin D vs 84.6% with control, p = 0.544).[^11] However, the vitamin D group did show some faster early healing: median time to achieve radiographic fusion was ~169 days vs 185 days in controls (log-rank p = 0.028).[^11] By 6 months post-op, the vitamin D–supplemented patients also reported lower back pain (VAS) and better function (Oswestry Disability Index) scores than controls.[^12] These secondary findings hint that vitamin D sufficiency might improve early recovery, but the sample was very small and not all endpoints were controlled for multiplicity. The authors themselves call for larger studies, as the trial may have been underpowered for fusion rate differences.

- **Observational Studies (Spine and Orthopedics)[^13]:** Numerous reports link vitamin D status with surgical outcomes. Vitamin D deficiency is common in orthopedic patients (often >50% of patients have suboptimal levels).[^13] A 2016 review of spine surgery outcomes found patients with low vitamin D had lower fusion rates and more persistent low back pain after fusion, compared to those with normal levels.[^13] Encouragingly, studies that treated vitamin D deficiency (in deficient patients) reported higher fusion success and improved pain scores versus untreated controls.[^13] Similarly, large cohort analyses have noted higher risks of complications (nonunion, infections, etc.) in vitamin D–deficient patients, suggesting that correcting deficiency can reduce surgical complications.[^13] In other types of bone surgery (e.g. fracture repairs, joint fusions), it’s become standard to replete low vitamin D as part of good perioperative care. The key point is that adequate vitamin D is important for normal healing, but giving mega-doses to patients who already have sufficient levels has not shown added benefit.

No direct studies in facial feminization or craniofacial surgeries exist, but the bone healing process is analogous to fractures/osteotomies. Extrapolating from orthopedic data: ensuring the patient isn’t deficient in vitamin D is reasonable, but there is no evidence that pharmacologic high-dose vitamin D accelerates osteotomy healing in an otherwise healthy adult.

## Safety and High-Dose Vitamin D Concerns

While maintaining normal vitamin D is beneficial, high-dose protocols (far exceeding daily requirements) raise safety issues without clear upside:

- **Toxicity Risks[^14][^15]:** Vitamin D is fat-soluble and accumulative; excessive dosing can cause hypercalcemia (elevated blood calcium), which may lead to kidney damage, vascular calcifications, or cardiac arrhythmias. For example, a case report documented an elderly woman given multiple vitamin D injections (total ≈2.4 million IU over a short period). She developed severe hypercalcemia (Ca 12.4 mg/dL) and a complete heart block arrhythmia due to vitamin D toxicity (25(OH)D level > 2000 ng/mL!).[^14] Despite aggressive treatment to lower calcium, she required a pacemaker for her heart rhythm.[^15] This extreme case highlights that indiscriminate mega-dosing can be dangerous. Even oral “loading doses” can overshoot safe levels if not monitored.

- **Upper Limits and Adverse Effects[^16][^17][^18][^19][^20][^21][^22]:** Authorities set the tolerable upper intake for vitamin D at 4,000 IU per day for adults – this is considered the safe maximum for chronic use.[^16] Routine daily doses of 800–2,000 IU are safe and sufficient for most people to correct deficiency.[^16] In contrast, research has shown that very large intermittent doses can have paradoxical effects. In one trial, a single 600,000 IU bolus caused a 50% spike in bone resorption marker (CTX) that lasted two months.[^17][^18] Likewise, an annual injection of 300,000–500,000 IU to older adults was associated with increased falls and fractures in the months after dosing.[^19][^20] Some monthly high-dose regimens (e.g. 60,000 IU/month) also showed higher fall rates compared to moderate doses.[^21][^22] These findings suggest that overshooting the optimal vitamin D level may actually undermine bone and muscle function – possibly by inducing calcium swings or altering vitamin D receptor responses. In short, “more is not better” with vitamin D beyond a certain point. The safest approach is to use modest daily dosing to maintain 25(OH)D in a normal range (~30–50 ng/mL), rather than high bolus therapy unless medically indicated.

## Conclusion: No Clear Benefit to High Doses for Healing

Current evidence does not support using high-dose vitamin D as a bone-healing aid after surgeries like facial feminization (which involve bone cuts). Ensuring adequate vitamin D status (repleting true deficiencies) is prudent and may prevent healing complications,[^13] but giving doses far above the physiological needs has not shown improved outcomes in clinical trials.[^2][^8] In fact, excessively high doses can impair bone remodeling or cause systemic harm.[^5][^14] The consensus from orthopedic studies is that vitamin D supplementation alone offers inconclusive to no added benefit for fracture or fusion healing in humans.[^2] High-dose strategies that succeeded in animals have not translated into human practice – at least not in randomized trials – and mega-dosing can be counterproductive or unsafe. Therefore, for postoperative bone healing, it’s best to treat vitamin D like a supporting factor: correct any deficiency to normal levels, but do not exceed recommended doses in hopes of faster healing.[^16] Instead, rely on proven practices (stable fixation, nutrition including calcium/protein, and time) for bone recovery. In summary, vitamin D is vital for bone health, but supra-therapeutic dosing has no proven healing benefit and carries real risks. Maintaining a normal vitamin D level is the goal – anything beyond that is unlikely to “super-charge” bone healing.
